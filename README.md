I asked myself the question "what is the minimum number of (NHL) hockey teams that have to lose their first game of a season if there are n teams and all teams play at least once within k days?" The answer was suprisingly interesting. I wanted to apply the idea to actual NHL data, so that's what I wrote up here.

The general idea here is that if we have unlimited days at the start of a season, we can grow the number of teams exponentially with only one team having to lose their first game on the first day. Also in the NHL, teams can't play 3 days in a row, so I took that into consideration. The recurrence relation ends up being A(n) = A(n-1) + 2A(n-3) with seeds 2, 4, 6. From there, we can look at the number of days we actually have, and partition the teams accordingly to get the answer to the question.
